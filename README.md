# Internship Project: Admissions Management System

This repository contains the work completed during my internship, focusing on tasks related to Admissions Management System. Task 1 and Task 2 were individual contributions, while the remaining project work was done collaboratively as a group.

## Task 1: Admissions

The "Admissions" unit handles the application and enrollment processes for new students. This includes managing applications, tracking application status, and communicating with prospective students.

### Task 1 Contents:

1. **RSD (Requirements Specification Document)**

2. **E-R Diagram**

3. **Database Structure**

## Task 2: Implementation

In Task 2, the code for the Admissions system was implemented using ASP.NET Core 6 MVC.



**Done by Group:**
   - The "Done by Group" folder contains the RSD of the work done together as a group.

## Notes:

- This internship provided valuable experience in both individual and group work settings.
- Task 1 and Task 2 showcase individual contributions, while the group work is reflected in the "Done by Group" folder.

Feel free to explore the specific tasks and group work. If you have any feedback, don't hesitate to reach out!
